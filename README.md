# Generating-Cartoon-Faces
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate cartoon faces. Utilizing deep learning techniques, we explore the dynamics between two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator, to produce new, unique cartoon avatars.
